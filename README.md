### Japan is a country where 30% of the population are elderly. 
### To ensure that the elderly can live in peace, we have developed an elderly-friendly app that facilitates mutual care.

# How to run our app.
The execution method is described in app/README.md.

# About our app
Our app is a mutual caregiving app.
A feature of our app is that caregivers can collaboratively manage the medication, schedule, and daily tasks of a care recipient with multiple people.
### Calendar
